# Tableau_Projects
## First Tableau project I worked on was based on analysis of health expenditure of various countries and how it affects various dependent variables such as 'Life expectancy', 'Infant mortality', 'Fertility rate', etc. to compare how increasing of decreasing the health expenditure by countries can lead to better standard of living for the citizens.
